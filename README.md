# 3DBulletHell
This is a collection of code written for a 3D bullet hell game I started making for Unreal Engine 4. UE4 is said to be finicky with Git, so this repository houses copies of the gameâ€™s source, not the originals that are used by the engine. I will test using Git with UE4 later, in a controlled setting. There are some interesting ideas in this code which I will revisit later, such as smart turrets and non-trivial ground movement.
